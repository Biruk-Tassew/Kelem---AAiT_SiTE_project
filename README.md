 This is a website where students and other users may submit any questions they have and get answers. We believe that this site would serve the educational society by giving an easily accessible means for students to acquire answers to their questions when no one else is available to assist them.

The following are the primary business features that our website would have: <br />
           1) Our system enables user to have an account, log in to thier account, edit at any time they wanted and delete their account if they insist.<br />
           2) It provides a way to Post their question, read questions posted by them or any oher user, edit the questions they posted or delete the questions.<br />
           3) It also enable a user to comment on any question, edit his/her comments or delete it.<br />
           4) Further more our system is prposed to provide an exam preparaton tests with multiple questions collected from different sources with a proven answers.<br />
           5) Users on our system could upgrade their accounts to a premium account from which they get the benefit of getting expert proven answers, exclusive test preparation                 questions on different subjects and other proposed benefits.<br />
           6) Educational materials on various subject whether as a sugustion for a user who posted a question or just for every one to read.<br />
           
The qualities listed above are the main ones that our system is supposed to have. We are supposed to offer an authentication mechanism for the system in order for a user to have an account. We also need a mechanism to provide authorization to change or delete the account that the user created, and some other admins should be able to suspend or even remove a user's account if the user breaches the conditions of the site, which he/she is supposed to agree to when signing up. Another significant circumstance in which we require an authentication and specific permission system is when a user obtains a premium account. To have this sort of account, the user must pay a fee. For this aim, we need a highly secure system to validate whether or not the user has paid and, if so, whether or not he has received the unique offer for which he paid. We would create a dedicated desk where only authorized entities may grant or revoke specific rights granted to a user. 

We use the RESTful API to make our system function on a variety of devices. This is an excellent technique to decouple the server from the client and make our work more flexible.
Another significant advantage of the Rest API is that back-end and front-end teams may operate separately without one requiring the other to complete certain duties after both have the intended api. This simplifies the tests we'd do on each unit and paves the path for the best results when the units are integrated. 
         
The title we picked for our project is 'Kelem-ቀለም' which is an amharic word that has a contextual equivalence of meaning with 'education.' We believe that this name accurately represents what we want to undertake.
